# Document Comparison AI

**Lawmate’s Document Comparison AI** helps advocates quickly identify what changed between two versions of a legal document, so you can review faster, reduce drafting errors, and prepare with confidence.

Whether you are reviewing a revised petition, checking edits before filing, or validating changes sent by opposing counsel, this feature gives you a structured, lawyer-friendly view of differences.

## What it does

Document Comparison AI analyzes two documents and highlights:

- Added content
- Removed content
- Modified wording
- Reordered sections
- Potentially significant legal changes in meaning

It is designed to go beyond simple line-by-line matching by helping you spot substantive edits that can affect legal strategy, filing quality, or compliance.

## Why it matters

In legal practice, even small wording changes can materially impact interpretation. Manual comparison is slow and error-prone, especially for long or frequently revised drafts.

With this feature, you can:

- Catch critical edits before submission
- Reduce review time for draft iterations
- Improve internal quality control
- Track negotiation changes more clearly
- Build confidence in final filing versions

## Typical use cases

Advocates and law firms commonly use Document Comparison AI for:

- Petition draft vs final filing
- Affidavit versions before notarization
- Agreement revisions during negotiation
- Client-provided version vs chamber version
- Court order draft vs corrected draft
- Junior-associate draft vs partner-reviewed draft

## How to use it

1. Open **Document Comparison AI** from your dashboard.
2. Upload or select the **base/original** document.
3. Upload or select the **revised/new** document.
4. Start comparison.
5. Review changes in the generated comparison output.
6. Use findings to update your draft, prepare notes, or share with your team.

## Best practices for better results

- Compare similar document types and formats.
- Use clean, text-readable files when possible.
- Label files clearly (for example: `Petition_v1` and `Petition_v3_final`).
- Treat major structural rewrites as separate review passes.
- Always do final legal validation before filing.

## Data and privacy (help center summary)

Document comparison is performed within your authenticated Lawmate workspace. Access is tied to your user session and role permissions. For sensitive matters, follow your firm’s standard document handling policies and avoid uploading unnecessary personal data.

## Important note

Document Comparison AI is a legal productivity tool, not a substitute for professional legal judgment. It helps surface changes quickly, but filing responsibility and final review remain with the advocate.

## Document Comparison AI FAQ

### 1. What is Document Comparison AI used for?
It compares two legal documents and highlights additions, deletions, and edits so you can review revisions faster and more accurately.

### 2. Which document should I upload first?
Upload the older or baseline file as the first document, and the newer/revised file as the second document. This makes change direction easier to understand.

### 3. What file formats are supported?
Use the same formats supported in your Lawmate document workflows (typically PDF and text-based legal documents). If a file is image-only or scanned poorly, results may be limited.

### 4. Does it detect only text changes?
It primarily focuses on textual and structural changes. It can help indicate meaning-level edits, but you should still perform a legal review for final interpretation.

### 5. Can I compare large documents?
Yes, but very large files may take longer to process. For best performance, compare clean and relevant versions instead of heavily mixed bundles.

### 6. What if the output misses a change?
Try re-uploading cleaner versions (searchable text PDFs), ensure correct version order, and run comparison again. For critical work, always do a final manual verification.

### 7. Is the comparison legally conclusive?
No. It is an assistive review tool. The advocate remains responsible for legal interpretation, drafting quality, and filing decisions.

### 8. Is my document data private?
Yes. Comparisons run within your authenticated Lawmate account. Access is controlled by your login/session permissions and your firm’s access setup.

### 9. Can I use this for contracts and negotiations?
Yes. It is useful for contract rounds, settlement drafts, affidavits, petitions, and any document where revision tracking matters.

### 10. How do I get the best comparison quality?
Use text-readable files, keep naming clear (`Draft_v1`, `Draft_v2`), compare logically related versions, and avoid mixing unrelated annexures in the same run.

### 11. Why does formatting look different even when text is similar?
Layout, spacing, OCR artifacts, and PDF generation differences can create visual variation. Focus on substantive text changes and key clauses.

### 12. Can I compare documents uploaded by different team members?
Yes, as long as they are accessible in your workspace under your permission scope.

# Judgement Analyzer AI

# Legal Translator AI

**Legal Translator AI** in Lawmate helps advocates translate legal content between English and Malayalam while preserving legal meaning, structure, and drafting intent.

It is built for legal workflows where clarity, terminology consistency, and court-ready language quality matter.

## What it does

Legal Translator AI helps you:

- Translate legal text and documents with legal context awareness
- Preserve formal drafting tone
- Keep section structure and legal references readable
- Improve consistency in repeated legal terms across documents
- Speed up bilingual drafting and review workflows

## Official legal glossary support

Lawmate’s Legal Translator AI is aligned with the **official legal glossary of the High Court of Kerala**.  
This glossary guidance is used to improve term consistency and reduce ambiguity in legal vocabulary during translation.

That means common legal terms are translated with a stronger preference for court-recognized terminology rather than generic dictionary-style wording.

## Why it matters

Legal translation is high-risk: small wording errors can change interpretation.

With Legal Translator AI, you can:

- Reduce manual translation effort
- Improve terminology consistency across filings
- Prepare bilingual drafts faster
- Support better internal review before finalization

## Typical use cases

- Translating petitions, affidavits, and supporting statements
- Preparing Malayalam client summaries from English legal drafts
- Translating Malayalam records into working English for strategy
- Standardizing legal term usage across chambers/teams
- Pre-submission translation quality pass

## How to use it

1. Open **Legal Translator AI** in Lawmate.
2. Paste text or upload the target document.
3. Select source and target language.
4. Run translation.
5. Review output, especially names, dates, citations, and relief language.
6. Finalize after advocate/legal review.

## Best practices

- Use clean, complete source text (run OCR first for scanned files).
- Keep paragraph breaks and headings clear in source content.
- Always verify proper nouns, case numbers, dates, and statutory references.
- Use AI output as first draft; do a legal review pass before filing.
- Keep your chamber style guide consistent with glossary-preferred terms.

## Data and privacy (help center summary)

Legal Translator AI runs inside your authenticated Lawmate workspace with permission-based access. Follow your firm’s confidentiality policies while translating client-sensitive documents.

## Important note

Legal Translator AI is a legal productivity assistant, not a substitute for professional legal validation. Final drafting accuracy and filing responsibility remain with the advocate.

## Legal Translator AI FAQ

### 1. What is Legal Translator AI used for?
It translates legal text/documents for advocate workflows while preserving legal context and formal drafting style.

### 2. Does it use official court terminology?
Yes. Lawmate relies on the **official legal glossary of the High Court of Kerala** to improve legal term consistency.

### 3. Is it better than generic translators for legal content?
For legal workflows, yes. It is tuned for legal terminology and structure rather than everyday conversational translation.

### 4. Can I translate full legal documents?
Yes, depending on file size and format limits in your workspace.

### 5. What languages are supported?
It is primarily used for English–Malayalam legal translation workflows.

### 6. Should I run OCR before translation for scanned PDFs?
Yes. OCR first usually improves translation quality significantly.

### 7. Can it preserve legal section formatting?
It aims to preserve structure, but you should still review formatting before final use.

### 8. Does it guarantee court-ready final language?
No. It provides a strong first draft. Advocate review is still mandatory.

### 9. What should I always verify manually?
Party names, case numbers, dates, statute/citation references, and relief/prayer language.

### 10. Is this suitable for client communication drafts?
Yes, especially for bilingual communication, after legal review and tone check.

### 11. Is translated data private?
Yes. It remains within your authenticated Lawmate workspace under permission controls.
