# Marketing plan addendum: Chrome extension

Add the following to the LawMate marketing site plan (meridian theme).

## Feature to surface

**Chrome extension (Lawmate Case Sync)** — Syncs cases and documents from the **Kerala High Court e-filing website** (ecourt.keralacourts.in) into LawMate. Available on the **Chrome Web Store**. Users sign in once in the extension, then use "Sync Now" or auto-sync when they're on the e-filing site. Tagline: "Sync your court cases into LawMate without leaving the e-filing portal."

## Where to mention it

- **Feature list (Cases & documents):** Add as a bullet after "Cases" in section 4 (one workspace). Copy: *Chrome extension (Lawmate Case Sync) — Syncs cases and documents from the Kerala High Court e-filing site into LawMate. Install from the Chrome Web Store; sign in once, then Sync Now or auto-sync on page load. "Sync your court cases into LawMate without leaving the e-filing portal."*
- **On the page:** Include a short block (e.g. "Sync from court" or "Also available") with a clear CTA linking to the Chrome Web Store listing. Optionally add "Chrome extension" to the header nav (e.g. next to Features / Pricing) linking to the store or to an in-page anchor.
- **Footer:** Optional link to the Chrome extension (e.g. "Get the Chrome extension" → store URL).

## Technical note

Extension lives in the repo at `extension/`; marketing site lives in `frontend/`. Use the production Chrome Web Store URL for the CTA (no code changes in the extension folder required for the marketing page).
